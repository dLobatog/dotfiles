" This is the timeout used while waiting for user input on a
" multi-keyed macro or while just sitting and waiting for another
" key to be pressed measured in milliseconds.
"
" i.e. for the ",d" command, there is a "timeoutlen" wait
"      period between the "," key and the "d" key.  If the
"      "d" key isn't pressed before the timeout expires,
"      one of two things happens: The "," command is executed
"      if there is one (which there isn't) or the command aborts.
"
" The idea here is that if you have two commands, say ",dv" and
" ",d" that it will take 'timeoutlen' milliseconds to recognize
" that you're going for ",d" instead of ",dv"
"
" In general you should endeavour to avoid that type of
" situation because waiting 'timeoutlen' milliseconds is
